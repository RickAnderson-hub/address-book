    Unit Tests:
        Purpose: To test individual components or functions in isolation from the rest of the app.
        Tools: Jest (often used in React projects), Mocha, Chai.
        What to Test: Functionality of individual components (e.g., rendering, handling props, state management, event handling).

    Integration Tests:
        Purpose: To test how multiple units work together.
        Tools: Jest along with React Testing Library or Enzyme.
        What to Test: Interactions between multiple components (e.g., parent-child components), proper data flow through the application.

    Functional Tests (End-to-End Tests):
        Purpose: To test the applicationâ€™s flow from start to finish.
        Tools: Cypress, Selenium, Puppeteer.
        What to Test: Entire user flows and scenarios (e.g., user registration, login process, creating and editing contacts in your address book app).

    Snapshot Tests:
        Purpose: To ensure UI does not change unexpectedly.
        Tools: Jest with React Testing Library or Enzyme.
        What to Test: Capture snapshots of your React components and compare them to previous snapshots.

    Accessibility Tests:
        Purpose: To ensure your application is accessible to as many users as possible, including those with disabilities.
        Tools: axe-core, Jest-axe for automated testing; manual testing using screen readers and keyboard navigation.
        What to Test: Accessibility features like keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, color contrast, etc.

Testing Strategies:

    Prioritize Critical Paths: Focus on testing the most critical parts of your application first, such as user authentication or key features of your address book application.
    Test as You Develop: Incorporate testing into your development process rather than leaving it to the end.
    Balance Different Types of Tests: While unit tests are important, don't neglect integration and end-to-end tests, as they can catch issues that unit tests might miss.
    Automate Where Possible: Automated tests save time and can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline. Manual testing should complement automated tests, especially for usability and accessibility.
